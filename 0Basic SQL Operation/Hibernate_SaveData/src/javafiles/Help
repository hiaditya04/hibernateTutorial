	<id name="productId" column="pid"  >
		<generator class="assigned" />

	<id name="productId" column="pid"  >
		<generator class="increment" />
	</id>

	create sequence UserSequence incremented by 10;
	
	<id name="productId" column="pid">
		<generator class="sequence">
			<param name="sequence">UserSequence</param>
